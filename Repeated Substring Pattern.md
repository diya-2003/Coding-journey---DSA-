# Intuition
The problem seems to involve finding if a given string can be constructed by repeatedly appending a substring of itself. My initial thought is to iterate through possible substring lengths and check if the string can be divided evenly into substrings of that length.

# Approach
The approach involves iterating through possible substring lengths, from 1 to half the length of the string. For each substring length, we check if the string length is divisible by the substring length. If it is, we then check if the string can be constructed by repeating the substring. This is done by comparing characters at corresponding positions in the string and the substring. If all characters match, we return true.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input string. This is because we are iterating through possible substring lengths from 1 to $$n/2$$, and for each length, we check if the string can be constructed by repeating the substring, which takes $$O(n)$$ time.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as we are not using any additional space that grows with the input size.

# Code
```
bool repeatedSubstringPattern(char* s) 
{
    int len=strlen(s);
    for (int i=1;i<=len/2;i++) 
    {
        if(len%i==0) 
        { 
            bool valid=true;
            for (int j=i;j<len;j++) 
            {
                if(s[j]!=s[j%i])
                {
                    valid=false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(valid) 
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
