    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem seems to involve determining the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to string `s` to form string `t`. This suggests a need to find the longest prefix of `t` that can be found as a subsequence in `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "1. Traverse both strings `s` and `t`.\n",
    "2. Use two pointers: one for `s` and one for `t`.\n",
    "3. If characters in `s` and `t` match, move both pointers. If they do not match, move only the pointer in `s`.\n",
    "4. Count how many characters from `t` are matched within `s`.\n",
    "5. The result is the number of characters in `t` that were not matched (i.e., `length of t` - `number of matched characters`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- Time complexity:\n",
    "  The time complexity is \\(O(n + m)\\) where \\(n\\) is the length of `s` and \\(m\\) is the length of `t` because we are traversing both strings only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space complexity:\n",
    "  The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) as we are only using a fixed amount of additional space for pointers and counters.\n",
