# Intuition
The problem requires determining whether two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. Thus, the primary goal is to ensure that both strings have the same characters with the same frequency.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Character Count Arrays**: Use two arrays to count the occurrences of each character in the two strings. 
2. **Count Characters**: Iterate through both strings and update the count arrays.
3. **Compare Counts**: Compare the two count arrays. If they are identical, the strings are anagrams.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings. This is because we need to traverse both strings once to count the characters.
- **Space complexity**: \(O(1)\). The space used by the count arrays is constant (128 entries for ASCII characters).

# Code
```c
bool isAnagram(char* s, char* t)
{
  int cos[128]={0},cot[128]={0},c=0;
  for(int i=0;s[i]!='\0';i++)
    {
        cos[s[i]]++;
    }
    for(int i=0;t[i]!='\0';i++)
    {
        cot[t[i]]++;
    }
    for(int i=0;i<128;i++)
    {
        if (cos[i] != cot[i]) 
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
