Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem solution:

### Intuition
To determine the number of 3x3 magic square subgrids within a larger grid, we need to understand that a magic square requires all numbers from 1 to 9 to be distinct, and all rows, columns, and diagonals should sum to the same value. By iterating over all possible 3x3 subgrids and verifying these conditions, we can count how many such magic squares exist.

### Approach
1. **Identify Subgrids:** Iterate through the entire grid, checking every possible 3x3 subgrid.
2. **Validation Checks:** For each subgrid:
   - Ensure that the subgrid contains exactly the numbers 1 to 9.
   - Check that the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals are identical.
3. **Count Valid Magic Squares:** If both checks pass, increment the count of magic squares.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The solution involves iterating over each 3x3 subgrid within the grid, which has a time complexity of \(O((n-2) \times (m-2))\) where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid. Within each iteration, checking the grid's properties takes a constant time \(O(1)\). Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\).
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we only use a fixed amount of extra space for validation.

### Code
```c
bool isMagicSquare(int grid[3][3]) {
    int s1 = grid[0][0] + grid[0][1] + grid[0][2];
    int s2 = grid[1][0] + grid[1][1] + grid[1][2];
    int s3 = grid[2][0] + grid[2][1] + grid[2][2];
    int s4 = grid[0][0] + grid[1][0] + grid[2][0];
    int s5 = grid[0][1] + grid[1][1] + grid[2][1];
    int s6 = grid[0][2] + grid[1][2] + grid[2][2];
    int s7 = grid[0][0] + grid[1][1] + grid[2][2];
    int s8 = grid[2][0] + grid[1][1] + grid[0][2];
    
    // Check if all sums are equal
    return (s1 == s2 && s2 == s3 && s3 == s4 && s4 == s5 && s5 == s6 && s6 == s7 && s7 == s8);
}

bool contains1to9(int grid[3][3]) {
    int count[10] = {0}; // counter for digits 1-9
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            int num = grid[i][j];
            if (num < 1 || num > 9) return false;
            count[num]++;
        }
    }
    // Check if all numbers from 1 to 9 are used exactly once
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        if (count[i] != 1) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int numMagicSquaresInside(int** grid, int gridSize, int* gridColSize) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= gridSize - 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= gridColSize[i] - 3; j++) {
            int subgrid[3][3] = {
                {grid[i][j], grid[i][j+1], grid[i][j+2]},
                {grid[i+1][j], grid[i+1][j+1], grid[i+1][j+2]},
                {grid[i+2][j], grid[i+2][j+1], grid[i+2][j+2]}
            };
            if (contains1to9(subgrid) && isMagicSquare(subgrid)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

This code efficiently counts the number of 3x3 magic square subgrids within the provided grid.
