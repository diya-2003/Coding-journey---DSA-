## Intuition
The main idea is to use a prefix sum approach along with modular arithmetic. By keeping track of the frequency of prefix sums modulo `k`, we can efficiently count the number of subarrays that have a sum divisible by `k`.

## Approach
1. **Prefix Sum and Modulo Operation**: As we iterate through the array, we compute the prefix sum modulo `k`. This helps in identifying subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.

2. **Counting Frequencies**: We maintain a list `mod_k` of size `k` where `mod_k[i]` keeps track of how many times a particular prefix sum modulo `k` has been encountered. 

3. **Increment Count**: We increment the count of subarrays with a sum divisible by `k` based on the frequencies stored in `mod_k`.

4. **Handling Negative Values**: If the prefix sum is negative, we adjust it by adding `k` to ensure it falls within the range `[0, k-1]`.

5. **Combination of Prefix Sums**: Finally, for each frequency in `mod_k`, we calculate the number of ways we can pick pairs of these prefixes to form subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we make a single pass through the array to compute the prefix sums and another pass through the `mod_k` array of fixed size \(k\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the size of the modulo array. This is because we maintain a list of size `k` to store the frequency of each prefix sum modulo `k`.

## Code
Here is the solution based on the described approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraysDivByK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        mod_k = [0] * k
        mod_k[0] = 1
        prefix = 0
        for x in nums:
            prefix = (prefix + x) % k
            if prefix < 0:
                prefix += k
            mod_k[prefix] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        for n in mod_k:
            ans += n * (n - 1) // 2
        return ans
```

This code correctly implements the approach to solve the problem of finding the number of subarrays with a sum divisible by `k` efficiently.
