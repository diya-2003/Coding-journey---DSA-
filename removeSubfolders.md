### Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to distinguish main folders from their sub-folders. Sorting the folder paths lexicographically will place any sub-folder immediately after its main folder, allowing us to efficiently filter out sub-folders in a single pass.

### Approach
1. **Sort the Folders**: We start by sorting all folders lexicographically. This ensures that each main folder is directly followed by its sub-folders (if any).
2. **Filter Sub-Folders**: After sorting, we use a single pass to add only the main folders to our result:
   - Initialize `result` with the first folder as a main folder.
   - For each subsequent folder, check if it starts with the last main folder string in `result`, followed by a `/`. If it does, it's a sub-folder and is ignored.
   - If it does not, add it as a new main folder.
3. **Return Result**: After iterating through all folders, return the result list of main folders.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of folders. The single pass through the list takes \(O(n)\), resulting in an overall time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), required for the result list to store the main folders.

### Code
```c
int compare(const void *a, const void *b){
    return strcmp(*(const char **)a, *(const char **)b);}
char** removeSubfolders(char** folder, int folderSize, int* returnSize) {
    qsort(folder, folderSize, sizeof(char*), compare);
    char** result = (char**)malloc(folderSize * sizeof(char*));
    int count = 0;
    result[count++] = folder[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < folderSize; i++) {
        int len = strlen(result[count - 1]);
        if (strncmp(folder[i], result[count - 1], len) != 0 || folder[i][len] != '/')
            result[count++] = folder[i];
    }
    *returnSize = count;
    return result;
}
```
