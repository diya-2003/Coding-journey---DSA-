# Intuition
When finding the intersection of two arrays, we need to ensure that each element appears in the result as many times as it appears in both arrays. This requires us to count the occurrences of each element in one array and then check against the other array.

# Approach
1. **Counting Elements**: Use a hash map (or array in this case) to count the occurrences of each element in the first array.
2. **Finding Intersections**: Iterate through the second array and for each element, check if it exists in the hash map. If it does and the count is greater than 0, add it to the result and decrement the count.
3. **Dynamic Array Handling**: Use dynamic memory allocation to handle the result array. This ensures that we do not allocate more memory than necessary.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  The time complexity is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums1` and \(m\) is the length of `nums2`. This is because we iterate through both arrays once.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the count of elements in `nums1`.

# Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```
```c
/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
 */
int* cre(int *arr, int *capacity, int size) {
    int *temp, i;
    if (size == (*capacity)) {
        (*capacity) *= 2;
        temp = (int *)malloc((*capacity) * sizeof(int));
        for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            temp[i] = arr[i];
        }
        free(arr);
        arr = temp;
    }
    return arr;
}

int* append(int *arr, int *capacity, int *size, int data) {
    arr = cre(arr, capacity, *size);
    arr[(*size)++] = data;
    return arr;
}

int* intersect(int* nums1, int nums1Size, int* nums2, int nums2Size, int* returnSize) {
    int *result = (int *)malloc(nums1Size * sizeof(int)); // assuming the intersection array size will be at most nums1Size
    *returnSize = 0;

    int* count = (int*)calloc(1001, sizeof(int)); // assuming the values are in the range 0-1000

    // Count the occurrences of each element in nums1
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1Size; i++) {
        count[nums1[i]]++;
    }

    // Find the intersection
    for (int i = 0; i < nums2Size; i++) {
        if (count[nums2[i]] > 0) {
            result[(*returnSize)++] = nums2[i];
            count[nums2[i]]--;
        }
    }

    free(count);
    return result;
}
```
```c
int main() {
    int nums1[] = {4, 9, 5};
    int nums2[] = {9, 4, 9, 8, 4};
    int returnSize;
    int* result = intersect(nums1, 3, nums2, 5, &returnSize);

    for (int i = 0; i < returnSize; i++) {
        printf("%d ", result[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    free(result);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **cre**: This function reallocates memory for the array if the size equals the capacity.
2. **append**: This function appends a new element to the array, using `cre` to ensure there's enough space.
3. **intersect**: This function counts the occurrences of each element in `nums1` and then iterates through `nums2`, adding elements to the result if they are present in `nums1` and decrementing the count to ensure each element is added only as many times as it appears in both arrays.
4. In `main`, an example usage of the `intersect` function is shown, and the result is printed.

The corrected implementation ensures that each element appears in the intersection array only as many times as it appears in both input arrays.
