    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a 2D grid of size \\(n \\times n\\), where each cell can either contain a thief (1) or be empty (0), the task is to find the maximum safeness factor among all possible paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. The safeness factor of a path is the minimum Manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 1**: \n",
    "  - Input: `grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]`\n",
    "  - Output: `0`\n",
    "  - Explanation: All paths from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) go through the thieves in cells (0, 0) and (n-1, n-1).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Example 2**:\n",
    "  - Input: `grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`\n",
    "  - Output: `2`\n",
    "  - Explanation: The path has a safeness factor of 2 since the closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 2) is cell (0, 0) with a distance of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 3**:\n",
    "  - Input: `grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]`\n",
    "  - Output: `2`\n",
    "  - Explanation: The path has a safeness factor of 2 with the closest cell to the thief being at a distance of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the maximum safeness factor of any path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. The solution should be efficient given the constraint of \\(n \\leq 400\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach to Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Distance to Nearest Thief**: \n",
    "   - Use BFS starting from all thief locations simultaneously. \n",
    "   - This calculates the minimum distance to a thief for every cell in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find the Safest Path Using Priority Queue**:\n",
    "   - Use a max-heap (priority queue) to explore paths from the start cell (0, 0) to the end cell (n-1, n-1).\n",
    "   - The priority queue helps expand the path with the highest current safeness factor."

    "**Code Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - In the `__init__` method, the `roww` and `coll` variables are initialized to represent the movement directions: up, down, left, and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BFS (Calculate Distance to Nearest Thief):**\n",
    "   - The `bfs` method performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to calculate the minimum distance from each cell to the nearest thief.\n",
    "   - It initializes a queue `q` and iterates through each cell in the grid.\n",
    "   - If a cell contains a thief, its distance is marked as 0, and it is added to the queue.\n",
    "   - The BFS continues until the queue is empty, exploring neighboring cells and updating their distances if a shorter path is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find the Safest Path Using Priority Queue:**\n",
    "   - The `maximumSafenessFactor` method finds the maximum safeness factor using Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue.\n",
    "   - It initializes a priority queue `pq` with the starting cell's safeness factor.\n",
    "   - While the priority queue is not empty, it pops the cell with the highest safeness factor.\n",
    "   - If the popped cell is the destination, its safeness factor is returned.\n",
    "   - Neighboring cells are explored, and their safeness factors are updated based on the minimum distance to a thief.\n",
    "   - Updated cells are pushed into the priority queue for further exploration.\n",
    "   - The process continues until the destination cell is reached or no path is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Edge Cases Handling:**\n",
    "   - The code checks if either the start or end cell contains a thief. If so, it returns 0 as there is no safe path.\n",
    "   - If no path is found, the method returns -1 to indicate that there is no path from the start to the end cell.\n",

    "This solution efficiently calculates the maximum safeness factor of any path in the grid while considering all possible paths."
