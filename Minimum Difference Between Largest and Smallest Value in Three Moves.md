### Intuition
To minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array after removing up to three elements, we can sort the array and then consider removing elements from either end. Sorting helps us quickly access the smallest and largest elements, which is essential for efficiently finding the minimal difference.

### Approach
1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting the array will allow us to easily find the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Check the Array Size:** If the array has 4 or fewer elements, we can make all elements equal by removing up to 3 elements, resulting in a difference of 0.
3. **Calculate Possible Differences:** After sorting, consider four possible ways to remove three elements:
   - Remove the three smallest elements.
   - Remove the two smallest and the largest element.
   - Remove the smallest and the two largest elements.
   - Remove the three largest elements.
4. **Find the Minimum Difference:** Calculate the difference for each of the above cases and return the smallest difference.

### Complexity
- **Time complexity:** The time complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(1)\) if we ignore the space required for the sorting algorithm.

### Code
```
#include <stdlib.h>

int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {
    return (*(int *)a - *(int *)b);
}

int minDifference(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    if (numsSize <= 4) {
        return 0;
    }

    qsort(nums, numsSize, sizeof(int), compare);

    int option1 = nums[numsSize - 1] - nums[3];
    int option2 = nums[numsSize - 2] - nums[2];
    int option3 = nums[numsSize - 3] - nums[1];
    int option4 = nums[numsSize - 4] - nums[0];

    int minDiff = option1;
    if (option2 < minDiff) {
        minDiff = option2;
    }
    if (option3 < minDiff) {
        minDiff = option3;
    }
    if (option4 < minDiff) {
        minDiff = option4;
    }

    return minDiff;
}
