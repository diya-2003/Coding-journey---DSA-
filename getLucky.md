# Intuition
The problem involves transforming a string into a numeric value by first converting each character to its corresponding position in the alphabet, then summing these digits, and repeating the summing process a specified number of times. The intuition here is to repeatedly reduce the number until it becomes a single-digit sum after `k` transformations.

# Approach
1. **Character Conversion**: Start by converting each character in the string `s` to its corresponding numeric value (`'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26`).
2. **Sum Digits**: For each of these values, sum their digits.
3. **Repeat Summing**: Repeat the summing process for `k` iterations to reduce the sum further.
4. **Return Result**: After completing `k` iterations, the result will be the single-digit sum.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The initial conversion of characters to numbers takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
  - The summing process depends on the number of digits involved, which is at most a constant time operation, and the number of iterations \(k\). Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n + k)\).
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

# Code
```c
int getLucky(char* s, int k) {
    int i, sum = 0, n, m, value;
    for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        value = (s[i] - 'a' + 1);
        while (value > 0) {
            sum += value % 10, value /= 10;}}
    while (--k) {
        n = sum, sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            m = n % 10, sum += m, n /= 10;}}
    return sum;}
