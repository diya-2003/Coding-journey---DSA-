To solve the problem, the task is to determine if a linked list forms a subpath in a binary tree. A subpath in this context is defined as a downward path in the tree starting from any node and following only child links, either to the left or right. 

We can break this problem into the following steps:
1. We need to check for each node in the tree if there's a corresponding subpath starting at that node that matches the linked list.
2. For each node in the binary tree, we'll check if there's a matching subpath recursively by comparing the values at each level.
3. If there's a mismatch, we discard that path and check the next node in the tree.
4. The problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) approach, where we explore each node of the binary tree and check if the linked list is a subpath starting from that node.

### Plan:
- For each node in the tree, check if the linked list can start from that node (using a helper function).
- If it can, continue recursively checking if the linked list can proceed downward from that node in either the left or right subtree.
- If the current node doesn't match the linked list, move to the left and right children of the binary tree and repeat.

### Approach:
1. Write a recursive function `checkPath` to see if the current node of the binary tree matches the current node of the linked list and continues the matching downwards.
2. Write another function `isSubPath` that traverses the binary tree, calling `checkPath` at each node.

Here is the implementation:

```c
// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    struct ListNode *next;
};

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    struct TreeNode *left;
    struct TreeNode *right;
};

// Helper function to check if the linked list starting at `head` is a subpath starting from `root`
bool checkPath(struct ListNode* head, struct TreeNode* root) {
    // If we've reached the end of the linked list, it's a match
    if (!head) return true;
    
    // If we've reached the end of the tree, but not the end of the list, it's not a match
    if (!root) return false;
    
    // If the current values match, we continue to check left and right children
    if (head->val == root->val) {
        return checkPath(head->next, root->left) || checkPath(head->next, root->right);
    }
    
    // If the current values don't match, return false
    return false;
}

// Main function to check if the linked list is a subpath in the binary tree
bool isSubPath(struct ListNode* head, struct TreeNode* root) {
    // If the tree is empty, we cannot have a subpath
    if (!root) return false;
    
    // Check if there's a path starting from the current root node
    if (checkPath(head, root)) return true;
    
    // Otherwise, check left and right subtrees
    return isSubPath(head, root->left) || isSubPath(head, root->right);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **checkPath**: This function recursively checks whether the linked list starting at `head` corresponds to a downward path in the binary tree starting from the node `root`. It returns `true` if the entire list matches a path from this point onward.
   - If `head` is `NULL`, weâ€™ve matched the entire list.
   - If `root` is `NULL` or the values of `head` and `root` don't match, it returns `false`.
   - If the values match, it checks the left and right children of the tree node to see if the rest of the list can be matched in a path.
   
2. **isSubPath**: This function traverses the binary tree starting from the root and calls `checkPath` for each node.
   - If `checkPath` returns `true` for any node, it returns `true`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks the left and right subtrees.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree and \(m\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because, for each tree node, we may need to traverse the linked list in the worst case.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursion stack used in depth-first search.
