** Intuition**
The intuition behind this solution is to use recursion to traverse the n-ary tree in a postorder manner. In postorder traversal, we visit all the children of a node before visiting the node itself. This can be naturally implemented using a recursive approach.

**Approach**
1. First, we count the total number of nodes in the tree using a recursive `countNodes` function. This helps us allocate the correct amount of memory for the result array.

2. We then allocate memory for the result array based on the total number of nodes.

3. We perform the postorder traversal using a recursive `postorderTraversal` function:
   - For each node, we first recursively visit all its children.
   - After visiting all children, we add the current node's value to the result array.

4. Finally, we set the `returnSize` and return the result array.

**Complexity**
- Time complexity: O(n)
  Where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly twice: once during the counting phase and once during the traversal phase.

- Space complexity: O(n)
  We use O(n) space for the result array to store all node values. Additionally, the recursive call stack can go as deep as the height of the tree, which in the worst case (a skewed tree) could be O(n). Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).

The code you've provided implements this approach effectively. It uses separate functions for counting nodes and performing the traversal, which makes the code modular and easy to understand.
```c
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 * struct Node {
 *     int val;
 *     int numChildren;
 *     struct Node** children;
 * };
 */

void postorderTraversal(struct Node* root, int** result, int* index) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < root->numChildren; i++) {
        postorderTraversal(root->children[i], result, index);
    }
    
    (*result)[(*index)++] = root->val;
}

int countNodes(struct Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return 0;
    
    int count = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < root->numChildren; i++) {
        count += countNodes(root->children[i]);
    }
    
    return count;
}

int* postorder(struct Node* root, int* returnSize) {
    if (root == NULL) {
        *returnSize = 0;
        return NULL;
    }
    
    int totalNodes = countNodes(root);
    int* result = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * totalNodes);
    int index = 0;
    
    postorderTraversal(root, &result, &index);
    
    *returnSize = totalNodes;
    return result;
}
