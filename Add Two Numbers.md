# Intuition
The problem involves adding two numbers represented by linked lists, where each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order. This is analogous to performing column-wise addition as we do with numbers, carrying over any overflow to the next digit.

# Approach
To solve this problem, we can iterate through both linked lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits and managing the carry-over value. We'll create new nodes for the resulting linked list and link them together. The steps are:
1. Initialize a dummy head to simplify the node addition process.
2. Use two pointers to traverse the linked lists and an integer to store the carry.
3. Loop through both lists until all nodes and carry are processed.
4. At each iteration, sum the corresponding nodes' values and the carry, then create a new node with the digit part of the sum and update the carry.
5. Link the new node to the result list.
6. Return the result list starting from the node next to the dummy head.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \(O(\max(m, n))\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of the two linked lists.
- Space complexity: \(O(\max(m, n))\) due to the creation of the result linked list.

```c
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
struct ListNode *newnode(int num)
{
    struct ListNode *ptr=(struct ListNode*)malloc(sizeof(struct ListNode));
    ptr->val=num;
    ptr->next = NULL;
    return ptr;
}
struct ListNode* addTwoNumbers(struct ListNode* l1, struct ListNode* l2)
{
    struct ListNode *head = NULL;
    struct ListNode *current = NULL;
    int t=0;
    while(l1!=NULL || l2!=NULL || t)
    {
        int c=t;
        if(l1 != NULL) 
        {
            c+=l1->val;
            l1=l1->next;
        }
        if(l2 != NULL) 
        {
            c+=l2->val;
            l2=l2->next;
        }
        t=c/10;
        int temp=c%10;
        struct ListNode *ptr=newnode(temp);
        if(head == NULL) 
        {
            head = ptr;
            current = head;
        }
        else 
        {                  
            current->next = ptr;
            current = current->next;
        }

    }
    return head;
}
