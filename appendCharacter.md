# Intuition
The problem seems to involve determining the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to string `s` to form string `t`. This suggests a need to find the longest prefix of `t` that can be found as a subsequence in `s`.

# Approach
1. Traverse both strings `s` and `t`.
2. Use two pointers: one for `s` and one for `t`.
3. If characters in `s` and `t` match, move both pointers. If they do not match, move only the pointer in `s`.
4. Count how many characters from `t` are matched within `s`.
5. The result is the number of characters in `t` that were not matched (i.e., `length of t` - `number of matched characters`).

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  The time complexity is \(O(n + m)\) where \(n\) is the length of `s` and \(m\) is the length of `t` because we are traversing both strings only once.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are only using a fixed amount of additional space for pointers and counters.

# Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int appendCharacter(char *s, char *t) {
    int j = 0, lent = strlen(t);
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s) && j < lent; i++) {
        if (s[i] == t[j]) {
            j++;
        }
    }
    return lent - j;
}

int main() {
    int result, flag = 1;

    result = appendCharacter("coaching", "coding");
    if (4 == result) {
        flag = 0;
    }

    result = appendCharacter("abcde", "a");
    if (0 == result) {
        flag = 0;
    }

    result = appendCharacter("z", "abcde");
    if (5 == result) {
        flag = 0;
    }

    printf("%d", flag);
    return flag;
}

```

This code reads two strings `s` and `t` from the user, then calculates the number of characters that need to be appended to `s` to form `t` by finding the longest prefix of `t` that is a subsequence in `s`.
