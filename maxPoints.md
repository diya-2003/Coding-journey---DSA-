# Intuition
The problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently calculate the maximum points that can be obtained while considering the penalties for selecting cells that are far apart in consecutive rows.

# Approach
1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a DP array `dp` where each entry represents the maximum points obtainable up to the current row, ending at a specific column.

2. **DP Transition:**
   - For each row, use two passes (left-to-right and right-to-left) to update the DP values, taking into account the points and penalties efficiently.
   - In the left-to-right pass, calculate the maximum points achievable by moving rightward.
   - In the right-to-left pass, handle the case where moving leftward might yield a better result.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The maximum value in the DP array after processing all rows will be the answer.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  The solution processes each element in the matrix twice (once during the left-to-right pass and once during the right-to-left pass). Thus, the time complexity is \( O(m \times n) \), where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns.

- **Space complexity:**  
  The solution uses a single array `dp` of size \( n \) to store the results for each row. Therefore, the space complexity is \( O(n) \).

# Code
```c
long long maxPoints(int** points, int pointsSize, int* pointsColSize) {
    int m = pointsSize;
    int n = pointsColSize[0];
    long long* dp = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));
    
    // Initialize dp with the first row points
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        dp[j] = points[0][j];
    }
    
    // Iterate over rows starting from the second row
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        long long* new_dp = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));
        long long left_max = LLONG_MIN + 1;  // Update to LLONG_MIN + 1 to avoid overflow
        
        // Left-to-Right pass
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            left_max = fmax(left_max - 1, dp[j]);
            new_dp[j] = left_max + points[i][j];
        }
        
        long long right_max = LLONG_MIN + 1;  // Update to LLONG_MIN + 1 to avoid overflow
        
        // Right-to-Left pass
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            right_max = fmax(right_max - 1, dp[j]);
            new_dp[j] = fmax(new_dp[j], right_max + points[i][j]);
        }
        
        // Update dp with new_dp values
        free(dp);
        dp = new_dp;
    }
    
    // Get the maximum value in the last row
    long long result = LLONG_MIN;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        result = fmax(result, dp[j]);
    }
    
    // Clean up and return the result
    free(dp);
    return result;
}
```
