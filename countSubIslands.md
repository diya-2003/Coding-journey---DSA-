### Intuition
The problem requires checking whether each island in `grid2` is completely contained within an island in `grid1`. This means that for every `1` in `grid2` that forms part of an island, the corresponding cell in `grid1` must also be `1`. If even one cell of the island in `grid2` corresponds to a `0` in `grid1`, that island cannot be considered a sub-island.

### Approach
1. **DFS Exploration**: 
   - Use a Depth First Search (DFS) to explore each island in `grid2`.
   - During the DFS traversal, simultaneously check the corresponding cells in `grid1`.
   - If any cell in `grid2` is part of an island but the corresponding cell in `grid1` is water (`0`), mark the island in `grid2` as **not** a sub-island.

2. **Counting Sub-Islands**:
   - Start the DFS from any `1` found in `grid2`. After the DFS completes, if the island is still considered a sub-island (i.e., it passed the checks against `grid1`), increment the sub-island counter.

3. **Mark Visited Cells**:
   - Mark cells in `grid2` as visited (by setting them to `0`) after processing them, to avoid counting the same island multiple times.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The algorithm will traverse each cell in both `grid1` and `grid2` exactly once. The time complexity is therefore \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the grids.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) if we ignore the recursion stack. However, in practice, the space complexity is \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the maximum depth of the recursion stack, which corresponds to the size of the largest island.

### Code

```c
void dfs(int** grid1, int grid1Size, int grid1ColSize, int** grid2, int grid2Size, int grid2ColSize, int row, int col, bool* isSubIsland) {
    if (row < 0 || row >= grid2Size || col < 0 || col >= grid2ColSize || grid2[row][col] == 0)
        return;

    if (grid1[row][col] == 0)
        *isSubIsland = false;

    grid2[row][col] = 0;

    dfs(grid1, grid1Size, grid1ColSize, grid2, grid2Size, grid2ColSize, row + 1, col, isSubIsland);
    dfs(grid1, grid1Size, grid1ColSize, grid2, grid2Size, grid2ColSize, row - 1, col, isSubIsland);
    dfs(grid1, grid1Size, grid1ColSize, grid2, grid2Size, grid2ColSize, row, col + 1, isSubIsland);
    dfs(grid1, grid1Size, grid1ColSize, grid2, grid2Size, grid2ColSize, row, col - 1, isSubIsland);
}

int countSubIslands(int** grid1, int grid1Size, int* grid1ColSize, int** grid2, int grid2Size, int* grid2ColSize) {
    int subIslandCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < grid2Size; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid2ColSize[i]; j++) {
            if (grid2[i][j] == 1) { 
                bool isSubIsland = true;
                dfs(grid1, grid1Size, *grid1ColSize, grid2, grid2Size, *grid2ColSize, i, j, &isSubIsland);
                if (isSubIsland) {
                    subIslandCount++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return subIslandCount;
}
```
