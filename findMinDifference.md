# Intuition
The problem is essentially finding the minimum difference between time points in a circular 24-hour clock system. The first thought is to convert each time point into a total number of minutes since the start of the day, sort the time points, and then calculate the differences between consecutive time points. We also need to account for the wrap-around difference between the last and first time points to handle the circular nature of the clock.

# Approach
1. **Convert Time Points**: Convert each time point (in "HH:MM" format) into minutes from the start of the day. This makes it easier to compare time points.
   
2. **Sort Time Points**: Once all time points are converted to minutes, we sort them. Sorting ensures that consecutive elements in the list represent the shortest possible time differences, except for the circular case.
   
3. **Calculate Differences**: After sorting, calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of time points. The minimum difference will be either between two consecutive time points or between the last and the first time points due to the circular nature of the clock.

4. **Edge Case**: If there are more than 1440 time points, it means at least two time points are the same, so the minimum difference will be `0`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: 
   - Converting all time points to minutes takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of time points.
   - Sorting the time points takes \(O(n \log n)\).
   - Finding the minimum difference takes \(O(n)\).
   - Overall time complexity: $$O(n \log n)$$
  
- **Space complexity**: 
   - Storing the converted minutes requires \(O(n)\) space for an array of size \(n\).
   - Overall space complexity: $$O(n)$$

# Code
```c
int convertToMinutes(const char* timePoint) {
    int hours = (timePoint[0] - '0') * 10 + (timePoint[1] - '0');
    int minutes = (timePoint[3] - '0') * 10 + (timePoint[4] - '0');
    return hours * 60 + minutes;
}

int compare(const void* a, const void* b) {
    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);
}

int findMinDifference(char** timePoints, int timePointsSize) {
    if (timePointsSize > 1440) {  // More than 1440 points means a duplicate exists
        return 0;
    }

    int* minutes = (int*)malloc(timePointsSize * sizeof(int));
    
    // Convert time points to minutes
    for (int i = 0; i < timePointsSize; i++) {
        minutes[i] = convertToMinutes(timePoints[i]);
    }
    
    // Sort the time points
    qsort(minutes, timePointsSize, sizeof(int), compare);
    
    // Find the minimum difference between consecutive points
    int minDiff = 1440;  // Max difference is 1440 minutes (24 hours)
    for (int i = 1; i < timePointsSize; i++) {
        int diff = minutes[i] - minutes[i - 1];
        if (diff < minDiff) {
            minDiff = diff;
        }
    }
    
    // Check circular difference between the last and first time point
    int circularDiff = 1440 + minutes[0] - minutes[timePointsSize - 1];
    if (circularDiff < minDiff) {
        minDiff = circularDiff;
    }
    
    free(minutes);
    return minDiff;
}
```
