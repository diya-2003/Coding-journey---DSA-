To solve this problem, we need to find an array of length `n` (the missing observations) such that when combined with the existing `m` observations (`rolls`), the average of the total `n + m` observations is exactly equal to `mean`.

### Steps:

1. **Calculate the total expected sum**:
   The total expected sum of all `n + m` rolls is `mean * (n + m)` because the average value is given by `mean`.

2. **Calculate the sum of the observed `m` rolls**:
   Let's denote the sum of the `m` rolls as `sum_m = sum(rolls)`.

3. **Calculate the sum of the missing rolls**:
   The sum of the missing `n` rolls, `sum_n`, can be computed as:
   \[
   sum\_n = mean \times (n + m) - sum\_m
   \]
   This is the sum that needs to be distributed across the `n` missing observations.

4. **Check if it's possible**:
   Each missing roll must be a number between 1 and 6 (inclusive). Therefore, for the solution to be valid, the sum `sum_n` must lie within the possible range:
   \[
   n \times 1 \leq sum\_n \leq n \times 6
   \]
   If `sum_n` falls outside this range, it's impossible to construct a valid solution, so we return an empty array.

5. **Distribute the sum**:
   If it's possible, we distribute the sum `sum_n` across the `n` missing observations. One simple way is to start by assigning 1 to each of the missing observations, and then distribute the remaining sum to the observations without exceeding the maximum value of 6.

### Code Implementation:

```c
int* missingRolls(int* rolls, int rollsSize, int mean, int n, int* returnSize) {
    int total_sum = mean * (n + rollsSize);
    int observed_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < rollsSize; i++) {
        observed_sum += rolls[i];    }
    int missing_sum = total_sum - observed_sum;
    if (missing_sum < n || missing_sum > 6 * n) {
        *returnSize = 0;
        return NULL;    }
    int* result = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    *returnSize = n;
    int avg = missing_sum / n;
    int remainder = missing_sum % n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = avg + (i < remainder ? 1 : 0);    }
    return result;}

### Explanation:
1. **total_sum**: The total sum of all rolls, which should be `mean * (n + m)`.
2. **observed_sum**: The sum of the observed rolls in the `rolls` array.
3. **missing_sum**: The sum of the missing `n` rolls, computed as `total_sum - observed_sum`.
4. **Validity Check**: If the `missing_sum` is outside the range `[n, 6 * n]`, we return an empty array because it's not possible to find valid rolls.
5. **Distribution**: We start by distributing the integer division of `missing_sum / n` to all `n` rolls and then handle the remainder by adding 1 to the first `remainder` rolls.

### Time Complexity:
- Calculating the sum of `m` rolls takes O(m).
- Distributing the `missing_sum` over `n` takes O(n).
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m + n).
