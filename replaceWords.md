### Intuition
When given a list of roots (simple words) and a sentence, we want to replace any longer words in the sentence with their matching root from the list if the root is at the beginning of the longer word.

### Approach
1. **Convert Roots to Set**: First, we turn the list of roots into a set. A set lets us check if a root is present quickly.
2. **Split Sentence**: We break the sentence into individual words.
3. **Find Shortest Root**: For each word in the sentence, we check each possible starting part of the word (prefix) to see if it's in our set of roots.
   - We start with the shortest prefix and stop as soon as we find one that matches a root.
4. **Replace Words**: We replace the word with its root if we found a match. If not, we keep the word as it is.
5. **Join Words**: Finally, we put all the words back together into a single sentence.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: This approach is quite efficient. For each word in the sentence, we only need to check a few prefixes, so it's roughly proportional to the length of the sentence and the average length of the words.
- **Space Complexity**: We use extra space for the set of roots and the list of words, which is manageable.

### Code
Here's the code with comments explaining each part:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def replaceWords(self, dictionary: List[str], sentence: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Convert the list of roots into a set for quick look-up
        root_set = set(dictionary)
        
        # Step 2: Split the sentence into individual words
        words = sentence.split()
        
        # Step 3: Function to find the shortest root for a given word
        def find_root(word):
            # Check each prefix of the word
            for i in range(1, len(word) + 1):
                prefix = word[:i]
                # If prefix is a root, return it
                if prefix in root_set:
                    return prefix
            # If no prefix matches, return the original word
            return word
        
        # Step 4: Replace each word in the sentence with the appropriate root
        replaced_words = [find_root(word) for word in words]
        
        # Step 5: Join the replaced words back into a single sentence
        return ' '.join(replaced_words)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
dictionary = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
print(solution.replaceWords(dictionary, sentence))  # Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

### Explanation with Example
1. **Input**: Roots = ["cat", "bat", "rat"], Sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
2. **Convert Roots to Set**: {"cat", "bat", "rat"}
3. **Split Sentence**: ["the", "cattle", "was", "rattled", "by", "the", "battery"]
4. **Process Each Word**:
   - "the" -> no matching root, keep "the"
   - "cattle" -> "cat" is a prefix, replace with "cat"
   - "was" -> no matching root, keep "was"
   - "rattled" -> "rat" is a prefix, replace with "rat"
   - "by" -> no matching root, keep "by"
   - "the" -> no matching root, keep "the"
   - "battery" -> "bat" is a prefix, replace with "bat"
5. **Join Words**: "the cat was rat by the bat"

And that's the final output: "the cat was rat by the bat".
