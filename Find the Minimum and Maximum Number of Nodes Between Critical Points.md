## Intuition
First, we need to identify the critical points in the linked list. A critical point is a node where its value is either greater than both its previous and next node or less than both its previous and next node. Once we identify the positions of all the critical points, we can calculate the minimum and maximum distances between them.

## Approach
1. **Traverse the Linked List:** Use a pointer to traverse the linked list.
2. **Identify Critical Points:** Compare each node's value with its previous and next node to determine if it is a critical point. If it is, store its position.
3. **Calculate Distances:** 
   - If there are less than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]` since we can't form any distance.
   - Otherwise, compute the minimum and maximum distances between the critical points.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of critical points. In the worst case, this can be \(O(n)\).

public:
    vector<int> nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> criticalPoints;
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        int position = 0;
        
        while (curr != nullptr && curr->next != nullptr) {
            if (prev != nullptr && curr->next != nullptr) {
                if ((curr->val > prev->val && curr->val > curr->next->val) || 
                    (curr->val < prev->val && curr->val < curr->next->val)) {
                    criticalPoints.push_back(position);
                }
            }
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr->next;
            position++;
        }
        
        if (criticalPoints.size() < 2) {
            return {-1, -1};
        }
        
        int minDistance = INT_MAX;
        int maxDistance = criticalPoints.back() - criticalPoints.front();
        
        for (int i = 1; i < criticalPoints.size(); i++) {
            minDistance = min(minDistance, criticalPoints[i] - criticalPoints[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return {minDistance, maxDistance};
    }
