## Intuition
The problem requires us to check whether two binary trees can be made identical by flipping the left and right subtrees of any node zero or more times. The key observation is that at each node, the subtrees can either remain in their original positions or be swapped. Thus, we should recursively check both possibilities for each node.

## Approach
We can solve the problem using recursion:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If both nodes are `NULL`, the trees are trivially equivalent.
   - If one node is `NULL` and the other is not, or the values at the nodes differ, the trees cannot be equivalent.
   
2. **Recursive Step**:
   For non-`NULL` nodes with the same value, there are two ways the subtrees can be equivalent:
   - Without flipping: the left subtree of `root1` matches the left subtree of `root2`, and the right subtree of `root1` matches the right subtree of `root2`.
   - With flipping: the left subtree of `root1` matches the right subtree of `root2`, and the right subtree of `root1` matches the left subtree of `root2`.

3. We recursively check these two possibilities at every node, and if either of them is true, the trees are flip equivalent.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the smaller tree. This is because we visit each node once during the recursive traversal.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This accounts for the space used by the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), this could be \(O(n)\).

## Code
```c
bool flipEquiv(struct TreeNode* root1, struct TreeNode* root2) {
    if (root1 == NULL && root2 == NULL) 
        return true;
    if (root1 == NULL || root2 == NULL) 
        return false;
    if (root1->val != root2->val)
        return false;

    bool flip = flipEquiv(root1->left, root2->right) && flipEquiv(root1->right, root2->left);
    
    return no_flip || flip;
}
