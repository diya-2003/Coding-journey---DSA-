## Intuition
The task requires us to find the maximum possible bitwise OR value that can be obtained from any subset of an array and then count how many subsets achieve this maximum OR value.

The first thought is that for any subset, we can calculate the bitwise OR by iterating through the elements in that subset. Using the fact that there are \(2^{\text{numsSize}}\) possible subsets, we can calculate the OR for each subset and count how many times the maximum OR appears.

## Approach
1. **Maximum OR Calculation:**
   - First, calculate the maximum possible OR by performing the OR operation across all elements in the array. This gives us the maximum OR value we want subsets to match.

2. **Subset Generation using Bit Manipulation:**
   - Each subset of the array can be represented using a bitmask. If the \(i\)-th bit in the bitmask is set, then the \(i\)-th element in the array is included in the subset. 
   - For each subset, calculate its bitwise OR by combining the elements corresponding to the set bits in the bitmask.

3. **Counting Subsets with Maximum OR:**
   - For each subset, if the bitwise OR equals the maximum OR (computed earlier), increment the count.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity:**
  - We generate all subsets, which is \(2^{\text{numsSize}}\) subsets.
  - For each subset, we compute the OR of its elements, which takes \(O(\text{numsSize})\) time.
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(\text{numsSize} \times 2^{\text{numsSize}})\).

- **Space complexity:**
  - We use constant extra space for storing variables such as `maxOr`, `count`, and the loop iterators. Thus, the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

## Code
```c
int countMaxOrSubsets(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    int i, maxOr = 0, count = 0, totalSubsets = 1 << numsSize, subset, currentOr;
    for ( i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) 
        maxOr |= nums[i];
    for ( subset = 1; subset < totalSubsets; subset++) {
        currentOr = 0;
        for ( i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) 
            if (subset & (1 << i))
                currentOr |= nums[i];
        if (currentOr == maxOr)
            count++;
    }
    return count;
}

### Key Points:
- **Bitmasking** is used to generate all subsets.
- For each subset, we check if its bitwise OR equals the maximum OR value.
