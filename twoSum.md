## Intuition
The problem requires us to find two numbers in the array whose sum equals a given target. A brute force approach involves checking every possible pair of numbers to see if they add up to the target. However, a more efficient approach can be achieved using a hash map to store the numbers we have seen so far and their indices.

## Approach
1. **Brute Force**: 
   - Iterate through each element in the array.
   - For each element, iterate through the remaining elements to check if any pair sums to the target.
   - This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) and is straightforward but inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach (Using a Hash Map)**:
   - Use a hash map to keep track of the numbers we have seen and their indices.
   - For each element in the array, check if the difference between the target and the current element exists in the hash map.
   - If it does, we have found the pair.
   - This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) since we are only iterating through the array once.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - In the optimized approach, we traverse the array once, and each look-up or insertion operation in the hash map takes constant time on average.
- **Space complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We use a hash map to store up to \(n\) elements.

## Code

Here is the brute force implementation in C, as provided:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target, int* returnSize) {
    int* result = (int*)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numsSize; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                result[0] = i;
                result[1] = j;
                *returnSize = 2;
                return result;
            }
        }
    }
    *returnSize = 0;
    return NULL;
}
```
