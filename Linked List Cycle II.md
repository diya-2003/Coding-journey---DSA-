# Intuition
This code seems to be aimed at detecting a cycle in a linked list and returning the node where the cycle begins, if there is one.

# Approach
The approach is to use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as the "two pointers" technique. This algorithm uses two pointers moving at different speeds to detect a cycle in a linked list. Once a cycle is detected, another pointer is used to find the node where the cycle begins.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, because only a constant amount of extra space is used.

# Code
```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
struct ListNode *detectCycle(struct ListNode *head)
{
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) 
    {
        return NULL;
    }
    struct ListNode *ptr,*ptr1,*ptr3;
    ptr3=ptr1=ptr=head;
    while (ptr1!=NULL&&ptr1->next!=NULL) 
    {
        ptr=ptr->next;
        ptr1=ptr1->next->next;
        if (ptr==ptr1) 
        {
            while (ptr3!=ptr) 
            {
                ptr3=ptr3->next;
                ptr=ptr->next;
            }
            return ptr3;
        }
    }
    return NULL;
}
