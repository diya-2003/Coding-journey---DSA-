# Intuition
The problem requires counting the number of substrings that satisfy a given `k-constraint`. The constraint states that a substring must have either the number of `0`s or the number of `1`s be at most `k`. The intuitive approach is to consider every possible substring, count the number of `0`s and `1`s in each, and check if it meets the constraint.

# Approach
1. **Iterate Through All Substrings**:
   - Use a nested loop where the outer loop selects the starting index of a substring, and the inner loop expands the substring by including more characters.
   
2. **Count `0`s and `1`s**:
   - For each substring, maintain counters for `0`s and `1`s. 
   - As you expand the substring, update these counters accordingly.

3. **Check the Constraint**:
   - After updating the counters, check if either the number of `0`s or `1`s is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If the condition holds, count this substring as valid.

4. **Early Termination**:
   - If at any point the substring fails the `k-constraint`, terminate the inner loop early since any longer substring starting from the same index will also fail.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through all possible substrings, return the total count of valid substrings.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  The time complexity is $$O(n^3)$$. 
  - Generating all substrings requires $$O(n^2)$$ iterations, and for each substring, counting the number of `0`s and `1`s takes up to $$O(n)$$ time.

- **Space complexity:**  
  The space complexity is $$O(1)$$, as only a few integer variables are used to maintain counters and the total count, regardless of the input size.

# Code
```c
int countKConstraintSubstrings(char* s, int k) {
    int n = strlen(s);
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int zeros = 0, ones = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            if (s[j] == '0') {
                zeros++;
            } else {
                ones++;
            }
            
            // Check the k-constraint
            if (zeros <= k || ones <= k) {
                count++;
            } else {
                break;  // No need to check further as subsequent substrings will not satisfy the k-constraint
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```
